## Further Discussion on Next Meeting

1. Need to know the task scheduling polices in Cirrus, a more comprehensive evaluation and comparison is required.
2. Cirrus batch system has issue in my previous RL project while running.
3. GNN was originally proposed to solve this task as the policy network architecture, however, it is too complex to use, can I use a different network on it. Such as GAN.
